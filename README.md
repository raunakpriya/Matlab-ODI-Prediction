<h1 align="center"> ICC ODI 2019 World Cup Prediction </h1>

----

##### Tech Stack used:
* MATLAB
* MATLAB (App Designer)
* Excel
* ESPN Data Scraping using BS4
-----
# Achievement:
> Prediction of the top 4 semi-finalists,finalists among top 10 competiting teams of the world along with the winner.
# Approach:
> The data is scraped from online site https://espn.com (We can also use machine learning algorithms for this approach to train the data first  and then test and implement them)
Data is fetched and saved in a Excel file
MATLAB gets the data by “import data”. The two datasets that are used are:
TeamStatistics
Team vs Team Performance
-----
### For TeamStatistics, the  code link  is:

  https://github.com/raunakpriya/Matlab-ODI-Prediction/blob/master/TeamStatistics.m

### For TeamvsTeamPerformance, the code link is:

  https://github.com/raunakpriya/Matlab-ODI-Prediction/blob/master/TeamvsTeam.m
  
-----
# App Designer:
For app designing,appdesigner command in MATLAB used
code link for the interface is:
https://github.com/raunakpriya/Matlab-ODI-Prediction/blob/master/Interface.m
> This code is upto the selection of teams and getting the performances
Now the selection of semifinalists and then finalists are done using the Predefined mathematical functions
Finally, the winner prediction is done using mathematical prediction functions
